# Project Overview: TASPA

This project aims to revolutionize how Emergency Department (ED) doctors are trained to admit patients to specialists by leveraging AI-powered synthetic patients and real-time decision assessment. The system uses an 11GB dataset of de-identified Electronic Medical Records (EMR) to create realistic patient scenarios, evaluate trainee performance, and provide actionable feedback.

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge of Efficient Patient Admissions
In the high-pressure environment of Emergency Departments (ED), doctors face the critical task of admitting patients to the appropriate specialists swiftly and accurately. However, this process is often fraught with challenges:

- Timely and Accurate Admissions: ED doctors frequently struggle to make quick and precise decisions about patient admissions, leading to delays in care and potential adverse outcomes.
- Resource-Intensive Training: Traditional training methods, such as Objective Structured Clinical Exams (OSCEs), rely heavily on human actors to simulate patient scenarios. This approach is not only costly but also lacks scalability, making it difficult to train a large number of doctors effectively.- 
Lack of Realism in Training: Human actors, while valuable, cannot consistently replicate the complexity and rarity of real medical cases. This gap in training can leave doctors unprepared for unusual or complicated patient presentations.
The Impact

For medical professionals, these challenges translate into increased stress, potential errors, and a reliance on less-than-ideal training methods. For patients, the consequences can be even more severe, including delayed treatment and suboptimal care.


## Solution

1. Timely and Accurate Admissions
Why: ED doctors need to make quick and precise decisions to ensure patients receive the appropriate care without delay. Inaccurate or delayed admissions can lead to adverse outcomes and increased stress for medical professionals.
How:

Synthetic Patient Generation: Using generative AI models trained on an 11GB dataset of de-identified EMR, we create diverse and realistic patient profiles. These synthetic patients can present a wide range of medical conditions, including rare and complex cases that are difficult to replicate with human actors.
Interactive Patient Interactions: Our AI-powered conversational agents simulate natural-language interactions with trainees, providing a realistic and dynamic training environment. This allows doctors to practice and refine their decision-making skills in a safe and controlled setting.

2. Resource-Intensive Training
Why: Traditional OSCE training methods are costly and lack scalability. Human actors are limited in number and cannot consistently replicate the complexity of real medical cases.

How:
AI Actor Simulation: By building conversational AI using tools like Rasa and Dialogflow, we create virtual patients that can interact with trainees in real-time. This eliminates the need for human actors and significantly reduces training costs.
Scalability: Our platform can accommodate a large number of trainees simultaneously, making it possible to train more doctors efficiently. The use of cloud-based infrastructure ensures that the system can scale as needed.

3. Lack of Realism in Training
Why: Human actors cannot consistently replicate the complexity and rarity of real medical cases, leaving doctors unprepared for unusual patient presentations.

How:
Generative AI Models: By training our models on real EMR data, we ensure that the synthetic patients exhibit realistic medical conditions and variability. This includes comorbidities, rare diseases, and complex cases that are essential for comprehensive training.
3D Modelling: We use AI-based 3D modelling to simulate patient physical features, enhancing the realism of the training scenarios. This allows trainees to practice physical examinations and improve their diagnostic skills.

4. Real-Time Decision Assessment
Why: Immediate feedback is crucial for effective learning. Trainees need to understand the impact of their decisions and receive actionable insights to improve their performance.

How:
Rule-Based and ML Models: We develop rule-based and machine learning models to evaluate trainee decisions in real-time. These models compare actions against clinical guidelines and best practices, providing an objective assessment of performance.
Feedback Engine: Our feedback engine, powered by GPT-4 and LangChain, generates actionable insights and confidence scores. Trainees receive detailed feedback on their decisions, including specific recommendations for improvement.

5. Platform Integration and User Experience
Why: A user-friendly and integrated platform is essential for effective training and adoption.

How:
Web-Based Interface: We develop a web-based platform using React.js and Three.js, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience. The platform includes role-based access and an analytics dashboard for performance tracking.
HIPAA-Compliant Infrastructure: Data privacy and security are paramount. We use HIPAA-compliant infrastructure (AWS/Azure) to ensure that all data is handled securely and in compliance with regulations.

6. Validation and Continuous Improvement
Why: Continuous validation and improvement are necessary to ensure the effectiveness and relevance of the training platform.

How:
Pilot Testing: We partner with teaching hospitals to pilot test the platform, gathering feedback and measuring improvements in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This iterative process ensures that the platform evolves based on real-world needs and feedback.
Federated Learning: To keep the AI models up-to-date with new EMR data without compromising privacy, we implement federated learning. This allows the platform to continuously learn and improve while maintaining data security.
By addressing these key challenges with innovative AI solutions, our platform aims to revolutionize the training of ED doctors, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and more efficient healthcare delivery.
